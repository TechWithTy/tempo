# Tempo (Tracing Integration)

[![Tempo Tracing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tempo-Tracing-blue)](https://www.cybershoptec.com)

A modular, production-ready tracing and observability integration for Python/FastAPI services, designed for seamless use with Grafana Tempo and OpenTelemetry. This submodule provides utilities, best practices, and test scaffolding to ensure robust distributed tracing in modern microservices and monoliths.

## Features

- **Mockable and real trace roundtrip testing**
- **OpenTelemetry/Tempo compatibility**
- **Typed, documented test patterns**
- **Production best practices for trace ingestion and querying**
- **Easy integration with FastAPI and other Python frameworks**
- **CI/CD and DRY principles baked in**

## Usage

1. Add as a submodule:
   ```sh
   git submodule add <repo-url> backend/app/core/tempo
   ```
2. See [tests/_tests/](./_tests/) for integration examples.
3. Configure your tracing endpoints and environment variables as needed.
